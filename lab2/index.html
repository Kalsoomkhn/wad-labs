<h2>Report</h2>
    <div id="Report">
        <h3>What I Did?</h3>
        <p>I developed a portfolio website, more like a student intro website using html and css. <br> For html, I used heading, paragraph, div, anchor, ul, ol tags mainly.<br> Later on, I used css , styling, and colouring properties and have also used pseudo selectors for mouse movement in navigation bar.</p>

        <h3>Why I Chose These Tags and Styles?</h3>
        <p>I implemented semantic HTML elements like h1, h2, h3 for headings, which helped in improving readability. <br>Used 2 kind of Lists ol and ul to organize website links and other content in Likes and Dislikes. <br>Used dt instead of li because I don't wanted to make them look like bullet points.</p>

        <h3>What I Learned?</h3>
        <p>In this lab task, I learned making abeginner website using html and css, implemented the website structure and learned styling using css.</p>
